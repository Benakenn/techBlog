# 14 Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

## Your Task

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

Your task this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, Sequelize as the ORM, and the passport npm package for authentication. You may use Handlebars if you want, but it is not a requirement.

## Getting Started

Your application’s folder structure must follow the Model-View-Controller paradigm. You’ll need to use the [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) package to implement Handlebars.js for your Views, use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

You’ll also need the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to use environment variables, as well as all passport authentication packages listed in class.
